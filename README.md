# Java-Mastermind

**Java-Mastermind** is a two-player console version of the classic Mastermind code-breaking game, written in Java.  
The game runs entirely in the command-line interface and allows one player to create a secret code while the other tries to guess it within a limited number of attempts.

## 🧠 Game Description
One player (the **code maker**) secretly defines a sequence of colors.  
The second player (the **code breaker**) then tries to guess this sequence.  
After each attempt, the program provides feedback on how accurate the guess was.
The code breaker wins by finding the exact sequence before running out of tries.

## 🎮 Features
- Two-player gameplay (code maker vs. code breaker)  
- Fully playable in the command-line interface  
- Input validation for both players  
- Clear and minimal text-based feedback  

## 🧩 Technologies Used
- **Java (JDK 17 or higher)**  
- No external libraries required  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Compile the game:
   ```bash
   javac Mastermind.java
   java Mastermind
   ```
3. Code maker enters the sequence of colors
4. Code breaker tries to guess the sequence

## 🏫 Project Background

This project was created as a small Java exercise to practice console input/output, loops, condition handling, and game logic. 
And because it was fun!
